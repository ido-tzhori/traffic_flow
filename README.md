## Introduction

This project is aimed at simulating traffic flow on a single-lane circular road. The simulation is implemented in MATLAB and focuses on creating an accurate representation of traffic behavior through both macroscopic and microscopic models. By generating fundamental diagrams of traffic flow, the project aims to offer insights into traffic behavior and its underlying dynamics.

## Features

- Simulates traffic flow on a continuous, single-lane, circular road
- Implements both Greenshields' macroscopic model and a microscopic car-following model
- Includes Backwards Euler method for approximating the change in vehicle velocity

## Future Work

- Analyzing shockwave formations in traffic
- Investigating the impact of different initial conditions
- Adding various types of vehicles with different behaviors
- Extending the simulation to consider multi-lane roads
